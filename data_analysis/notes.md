Introduction

To start, our objective is to analyze a dataset on internet users in South Africa. Understanding these trends is crucial as they can inform policy decisions, business strategies, and technology development in the region.

Dataset Overview

The dataset we are examining includes information on internet users, specifically the percentage of the population using the internet over time. It includes two main columns: 'DATE' and 'INTERNETUSERS (%)'. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of how internet usage has evolved.

Data Loading and Cleaning

Next, we loaded the data using pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation in Python. To ensure the data is clean and usable, we performed several key steps:

-Converted the 'DATE' column to a datetime format.
-Removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
-Additionally, I implemented error handling to manage any issues that   might arise during data loading.

Basic Information

The basic_info(df) function provides a summary of our dataset. It displays:

The structure and data types of the dataset.
The shape, which helps us understand the size of our data.
Sample data and summary statistics to give a quick overview of the values.
This function is essential for getting a clear picture of what weâ€™re working with.

Data Visualization

Now, let's move on to our visualizations. The visualize_distributions(df) function creates two main plots:

First, we have a histogram that shows the distribution of internet users, complete with a Kernel Density Estimate. This helps us visualize how internet usage is spread across the population.

Second, we have a time series plot illustrating internet users over time. This plot reveals trends, peaks, or dips that can indicate significant changes in internet adoption.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The explore_data(df) function further deepens our analysis:

It provides descriptive statistics, giving insights into central tendencies and variability.
We check for missing data to identify any potential gaps.

Key Findings

From my analysis, several key findings emerged:

In the time series plot, we observed noticeable trends, including periods of stagnation in the beginning and then rapid growth near the middle in internet usage.
The histogram shows how the distribution of internet users varies, which can inform strategies for improving access and usage.
