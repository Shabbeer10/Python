## Why I'm Learning Python

I'm learning Python mainly because I want to become a data engineer, other than that it’s a versatile language used in many fields, such as web development, data engineering (of course), and automation.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here’s a list of topics I’ve learned and am currently practicing:

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, and basic operations
- **Control Flow**: `if` statements, loops (`for`, `while`)
- **Functions**: Writing and calling functions, parameters, and return values
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- **Modules and Libraries**: How to import and use external libraries

As I progress, I’ll update this list with new topics I learn.

## Installation

To follow along with my learning and run the code examples from this repository, you’ll need to install Python on your system.

1. **Download Python**: Install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-learning-journey.git
   cd python-learning-journey
